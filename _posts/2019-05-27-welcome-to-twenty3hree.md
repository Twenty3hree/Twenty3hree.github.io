## 历程

​		这间blog是我自lofter以外倾尽心血最多的一个了，前前后后折腾了快一周的时间，虽然每天都有些其他的事在不断的打断博客的建立，不过Finally！终于是建成了，OK，Great！

​		从最开始接触到Github Pages &  Jekyll —> Architect Theme —> NEXT Thme —> DIY Architect & NEXT Theme, it took me long time  to pick up a satisfied one. 最先是看中了Architect主题，可是又在Jekyll / Hexo / Hugo之间徘徊，不过总之我是要定了Architect！最后的最后还是觉得Jekyll 可以用，而且也是官方推荐，所以还是选择了J。可是Architect的使用特性太少了，太简洁了， 功能非常不完善。这时发现了NEXT主题，也是在一番纠结之后，选择了DIY，Combined Architect with NEXT to Twenty3hree's favorite theme, (My own Theme ^_& xixi)

​		Whatever,there are still a few of functions to add and these will be added later after I have post a series of posts on this blog because posts are the most important things on a Blog.

​		— So, just try to be a great Blogger!

​		— Double 'g'?

​		— Not sure, let me figure it out!

​		— … … 

​		— It's should be 'Bloger'!

​		— Wow!



​		At last, Todo list will add later and The frequency to release a new post should be at least once a week.
